Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

 => Install Node.js: React requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org. This will also install npm.

 => Install a Code Editor: Choose a code editor like Visual Studio Code if you havenâ€™t already.

 Step 2: Create a New React Project

  => Open Your Terminal: Use the terminal or command prompt on your computer.

      * npx create-react-app landing-page-website

   => Navigate to Your Project Directory:
      * cd my-new-project

Step 3: Start the Development Server
      * npm start

      => This command will open your new React app in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

Step 4: Explore the Project Structure
      
     => Understand the Structure:

          public/: Contains the public assets like index.html.
          src/: Contains the React components and styles.
          package.json: Manages dependencies and scripts.

     => Modify Files:

          src/App.js: Edit this file to modify the main app component.
          src/index.js: Entry point of the React application.
